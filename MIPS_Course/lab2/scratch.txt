Place for me to put notes while coding.

We need to implement two routines:
        find_gcd
                -- Computes the greatest common denominator between two numbers
                -- a0 is the original numberator
                -- a1 is the original denominator
                
                -- RETURNS:
                        -- V0 : The simplified numertor
                        -- V1 : The simplified denominator
                        -- t9 : the simplified integer part
        simplify
                -- Takes a complex fraction and produces a fraction in its
                   simplest form
