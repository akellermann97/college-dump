This program is written in Python 3 and has the following depedencies:

DEPEDENCIES:
Requests (requests)
BeautifulSoup (bs4)

In order for part 0 to be run successfully the command is as follows:
$ python3 fuzz.py test http://localhost/ --custom-auth=dvwa

Any URL should work as long as it correctly points to a DVWA login page. 
If it's pointed to the page that asks DVWA to be set up (the create/destroy
database page) it will not work. It needs to be pointed to a page that will
either redirect to the login page or the login page.

Part 1 - discover can be run using the following command
$ python3 fuzz.py discover http://localhost --custom-auth=dvwa

Part 2 - Test can be run using the following command
$ python3 fuzz.py test  http://localhost --custom-auth=dvwa --common-words=guessList.txt --slow=500 --vectors=vectors.txt

Note that supplying additional arguments that are relevant in part 2 to part 1
will not have any effect. Part 1 has been improved and more cookie finding functionality
has been added since its initial implementation.

The --common-words flag is implemented
The --vectors flag is implemented. Note that the headers of each section start with a '#' and then the vectors themselves
fall directly underneath them. Each heading is seperated by a line only containing '\n'. Any other format will not work 
correctly.

Thanks for grading my project!
